#Dynamic Programming:

    Dynamic programming is an algorithmic paradigm that breaks down a complex problem into smaller subproblems,
     solves each subproblem only once, and stores the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computation.
     This approach is particularly useful for problems that have overlapping subproblems or that can be decomposed into smaller subproblems.
