#Greedy Approach / Algorithm:

    In general terms an Algorithm that follows sequence of operations as the question mentions
     and isn't the most "optimal solution". But is a solution

Working of Greedy Approach depends on the Contraints of the Question.

##Note:

    --> When Greedy Approach Fails Dynamic Programming comes into the picture.
